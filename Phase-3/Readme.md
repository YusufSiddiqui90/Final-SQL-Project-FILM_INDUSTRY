🎬 Film Industry Database – Phase 3
Project Overview

Phase-3 focuses on advanced data retrieval and SQL logic. In this phase, complex queries are written using joins, subqueries, and functions to extract meaningful information from the Film Industry database.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joins & Subqueries

Different types of joins are used to connect the 25 tables, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN (if supported), SELF JOIN, and CROSS JOIN. Subqueries are also applied using scalar, correlated, and nested queries with IN, EXISTS, ANY, and ALL in both WHERE and FROM clauses.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions & Objective

Built-in SQL functions (string, numeric, date/time, and aggregate) are used for data formatting and calculations. In addition, multiple user-defined functions (UDFs) are created for project-specific calculations.
The main objective of Phase-3 is to demonstrate advanced SQL skills using joins, subqueries, built-in functions, and user-defined functions for complex and real-world data analysis.
